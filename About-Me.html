                    <p>I am a student at the Artificial Intelligence Master's programme at the University of Amsterdam. Over the years I have developed an interest in understanding the nature of intelligence, whether it be by learning about the human mind or by bringing complex behaviour in machines to life.</p>
                    <p>My passions revolve around science, technology, and philosophy. One of my favourite experiences in life is that of having my world-view changed that occurs after being exposed to new ideas. Through this website, I hope to inspire readers to learn more about these topics, the same way my peers and teachers inspire me. </p>

                </header>
                We are at a point in time where machines are capable of learning how to interact with the world around them.
                Developments in deep learning have allowed such agents to develop complex behaviours directly from raw visual perception.
                However, designing optimal input representations for these agents is a non-trivial task. Some of these might
                require layers of abstract representations to be learned before any meaningful behavior emerges, while others
                provide the agent with more direct access to relevant information for the task at hand.<br><br>
                I investigated this topic during my Bachelor's thesis, which later developed into a
                <a href="https://www.scitepress.org/PublicationsDetail.aspx?ID=yaA+xcdt4QE=&t=1">publication paper at ICAART 2019</a>.

                </header>
                When someone has a stroke a CT scan is performed to determine the extent of the damage inflicted to the brain tissue.
                Deep learning applications have proven to perform this task in seconds, rather than minutes/hours in human experts.
                However, data in medical applications is scarce, limiting the potential of such approaches.<br><br>
                During this internship, I managed to create an algorithm that generates realistic vessel structures. These can
                be used to create synthetic data sets that increase the amount of available training examples, and in turn,
                improve the performance of the trained algorithms. I whole discussion on this can be found on the
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00666">paper I wrote on the topic</a>.
