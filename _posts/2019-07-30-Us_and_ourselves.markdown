Consciousness is a term that is quite intuitive to every human being, yet if you are to ask anyone to provide you with a definition, you will receive broad and fuzzy description. The Oxford Languages dictionary defines consciousness as "The fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world". However, this simplification does not do justice to the large collection of literature that has been built on the subject.

Many schools of thought have provided a variety of competing ideas that aim to better understand what it is that gives rise to the process through which we experience our surroundings and our mind's inner mechanisms. The most unsettling part is not that we can't seem to discover the precise answers to our sentience, it is the fact that we don't even know what are the questions we should be asking.

What is consciousness? Why is it, evolutionarily speaking, beneficial for consciousness to develop? Where is the line between a conscious system and a non-conscious one? Is it even possible to objectively determine whether anything is conscious?

To begin answering these questions, we should first note that the term 'consciousness' gets thrown around under multiple distinct meanings. The <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/#ConCon">Standford Encyclopedia</a> defines two general ideas: _Creature consciousness_ and _State consciousness_. The former has to do with the level of awareness we associate to an external creature, while the latter is the notion we use to describe the mental state that a being is currently in.  The Standford page goes into much deeper detail that I can possibly explore in this post, and I recommend you give it a read if your want a nice introduction into this field of philosphy.


## <u>Creature consciousness and the evolutionary perspective</u>
Lets say we define consciousness as awareness of one's environment and it's internal states. Perhaps a simpler way to explore consciousness is by trying to comparing the levels of consciousness of different entities. On the one side, everyone would agree that a simple stone is not at all consciouss. However, what about a mouse? Ok, maybe a mouse is couscious enough to deserve the term, but what about a spider? Spiders are capable of navigating their surroundings, as well as being aware of their inner biological needs. So maybe we can squeeze spiders under the 'consciousness' umbrella? What about single-celled organisms? 

What I'm getting at here is that maybe this form consciousness can be seen as a spectrum with inanimate objects on one side and complex intelligence beings on the other. Maybe over many small incremental states, evolution has climbed this scale from innanimate unicellular processes, to somewhat-conscious simple multicellular organisms, to the complex intelligent apes we are today.

The youtube channel **In a Nutshell** has a <a href="https://youtu.be/H6u0VBqNBQ8">very nice video</a> on this very idea. The first step towards consciousness is possibly a unicelullar being capable of reacting to the level of food in its environment. Reacting to inner states such as the level of hunger yields advantages in the evolutionary process. Furthermore, being aware of your surroundings, as well as building an inner representation of the world around you allows for navigating towards food sources. Soon after, we start having complex creatures with ever-more developed cognitive functions that will eventually resemble organisms that we more traditionally refer to 'conscious'.

But this definition is not without its flaws. transitor
