The ways in which technology appears to change society every few years tend to be sudden and unpredictable. However, most often than not, the core ideas that drive the change are not by any means new. Like with most field of research, the groundwork required for a technological breakthrough is laid out over the course of years.

Despite the rise in popularity of the self-diriving car in recent years, the quest to automate vehicles is one that is more well stablished than people think. Two great industry examples where high level autonomous control is already being deployed are airplanes and large sea vessels.

In the case of navigation at sea, as of recent years, the number of crew members operating the vessel has diminished significantly. No longer is someone needed to perform complex calculations to predict the location and trajectory of the ship, all of that is handled by the onboard computer. The job of ship captains has become one of supervising the computer rather than piloting. One might naively think that programming a machine to navigate in open sea is rather trivial. Set a course straight to your destination, correct course according to weather conditions, dodge other ships. Heart attack. Driving into port is different.
